Evaluation
----------

In order to get UPnP to work on a ruby 1.9 stack, a patched "soap4r" gem is 
necessary. The Gemfile is set so Bundler installs this patched gem from github.

I also found it necessary to patch the UPnP gem so that it would run. There were
many errors due to the code attempting to strip nil strings. My patches fix these
issues and also include Bundler setup in the upnp_discover and upnp_listen
executables. The Bundler setup is required so that the soap4r gem from github
gets loaded.

Further detail on dependencies and patches below. I found this sufficient to
execute the supplied tools upnp_discover and upnp_listen as well as write some
basic test code.

There are still loads of warnings, so the output is not pretty. It does,
however, appear to work.

Enter the commands under "Use" below to install, patch and run upnp_discover.

Use

NOTE: This assumes you are using RVM to manage your Rubies and Gems.
(http://beginrescueend.com/)

$ git clone git://github.com/starfry/UPnP-Ruby-1.9-Evaluation.git
$ cd UPnP-Ruby-1.9-Evaluation
$ patch -d $GEM_HOME/gems/UPnP-1.2.0/lib/UPnP -p0 < patch/control.patch
$ patch -d $GEM_HOME/bin < patch/bin.patch

Then one or more of:

$ upnp_discover
or
$ upnp_listen
or
$ ./upnp_test.rb

Dependencies
------------

Soap4r (needed by UPnp):
Github: https://github.com/felipec/soap4r
git://github.com/felipec/soap4r.git

This soap4r clone includes fix for "XML processor module not found." as described
at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5754965/ruby-soap4r-wsdl2ruby-rb-errors
and http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?pid=132126#p132126.

Patch 
-----

The following patch file fixes problems with UPnP under Ruby 1.9
It modifies two files: control/device.rb and control/service.rb

$ patch -d $GEM_HOME/gems/UPnP-1.2.0/lib/UPnP -p0 < patch/control.patch

The following patch file adds Bundler setup to the executable ruby scripts
upnp_discover and upnp_listen. This is required so that soap4r is correctly
initialised.

$ patch -d $GEM_HOME/bin < patch/bin.patch
