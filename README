Patch 
-----

The following patch file fixes problems with UPnP under Ruby 1.9
It modifies two files: control/device.rb and control/service.rb

$ patch -d $GEM_HOME/gems/UPnP-1.2.0/lib/UPnP -p0 < patch/control.patch

The following patch file adds Bundler setup to the executable ruby scripts
upnp_discover and upnp_listen. This is required so that soap4r is correctly
initialised.

$ patch -d $GEM_HOME/bin < patch/bin.patch
